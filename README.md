To make battles more interesting, the game also implements features of Critical Hits and Avoid Rates. A Critical Hit is a chance that the attack’s damage will be made more powerful. This chance can happen to all three of the attack types.

Meanwhile, an Avoid is a chance that the player’s fighter will avoid the enemy’s attack, ignoring the attack’s damage completely.
